Welcome to the official codebase for the research "Densely Populated Regions Face Masks Localization and Classification Using Deep Learning Models" by our research team from [International University - VNU-HCM](https://hcmiu.edu.vn/en/)


## Abstract
Over the last two years, the correct wearing of facial masks in public is still a relevant matter in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
A popular approach that helps regulate this by global researchers is the application of Deep Learning.
This paper will contribute to the literature in two main aspects:
1. We first compare and contrast the application of four pre-trained models in classification of the specific face mask dataset.
2. We follow with the proposal of a face mask detector model which combines the state-of-the-art RetinaFace to the localization of faces in densely populated regions and the most prominent classifier obtained from the previous step to divide the faces into three categories: correctly-worn, incorrectly-worn and no-masks-worn.

Performance metrics from the test phase have announced our detector to achieve the best accuracy among all works compared with $94,59$\% on one test dataset and a less satisfactory $69.6$\% on another due to certain characteristics of the set.
